            <p>
                Hello, My name is Chris. Welcome to my very first website! Things may look pretty rudimentary, but I ask
            that you bare with me on my first adventure into web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a student in Oregon State University's post-baccalaureate computer science program.
            I have always been a computer enthusiast, but never tried anything more complex than building a tower by
            myself. When I was exposed to some simple elements of programming through my work in the sciences, I knew
            right away that it needed to be the next step I take in life. With the advent of COVID-19 I saw an
            opportunity and applied to OSU for the fall term of 2020. Since then I have been working through the courses
            while also working as a childcare professional for children with special needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before all of this, I was an analytical chemist working in food chemistry. I had graduated with a degree
            in biology from University of Wisconsin Oshkosh in 2017 and joined the "labrat" workforce almost right away.
            The work was engaging and challenging, but I was always looking for something a little extra. One day, I was
            given the opportunity to work as a superuser for our LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System)
            software. The training took a month or so, but I was eventually helping my team in an IT capacity. I found
            this workload to be much more enjoyable than routine lab work so I tried to get as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my experience in the lab, I also have a history in healthcare as a CNA and EMT. I have used this
            experience to join first responder teams both inside and out of work. I have also leveraged it most recently
            to start working as a childcare specialist to fill a need gap created by the pandemic.</p>
